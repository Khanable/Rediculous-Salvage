An old game i started.

Got as far as the random ship generator.

From memory, the premise was:
- Spawn in a random ship with a configuration you don't know how to control
- Get to a specific location as quick as possible while avoiding asteroids and taking little damage.

Theres a working build of the random ship generation viewer in ship-viewer-build I found in my old webserver backup.

Current tip looks like I was in the middle of moving away from webpack and to parcelJS bundler
